The `Model` class captures what we refer to as a \"model\" or as a \"network\". Using Subclassing, we can create a class for our model, and then define the forward pass through the network using the `call` function. Subclassing affords the flexibility to define custom layers, custom training loops, custom activation functions, and custom models.
