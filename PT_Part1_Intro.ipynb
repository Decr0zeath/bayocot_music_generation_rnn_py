At its core, PyTorch provides an interface for creating and manipulating [tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html), which are data structures that you can think of as multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors are represented as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes such as a string or integer -- they provide a way to generalize vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. PyTorch provides the ability to perform computation on these tensors, define neural networks, and train them efficiently.\n",
